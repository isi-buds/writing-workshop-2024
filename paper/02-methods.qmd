Let $i = 1, \dots, N$ be the unit in our amazing dataset, $Y_i$ be the outcome variable of interest for unit $i$ in this amazing application and let $X_i$ be the preditor of interest for unit $i$.

A linear regression model assumes that

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i $${#eq-lin-reg}

In the linear regression model of @eq-lin-reg, $\varepsilon_i$ are independent and identically distributed Normal variables.
